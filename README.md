> Predicting music platform customer churn using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project aims to predict whether a user of a music streaming platform will **churn** (i.e., cancel their subscription) based on their behavior, subscription type, location, and interaction with the platform.

We applied **classification models** to a labeled dataset to identify users likely to leave, helping businesses take action to retain them.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- ðŸŽ¯ **Random Forest**
- âš¡ **LightGBM**
- ðŸ“ˆ **XGBoost**
- ðŸ¤– **TensorFlow Neural Network (DNN)**

After preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning (with GridSearchCV), the best-performing model achieved:

- **Accuracy**: `~83%`
- **AUC Score**: `~0.92`
